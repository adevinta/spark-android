# Releasing

1. Update the `version` in [gradle.properties](gradle.properties) to a non-`SNAPSHOT`.
2. Update [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)
  - Add the new version section and move the *unreleased changes* into it.
  - Update the links at the end of the page.
3. Commit and push the changes to a new PR
   ```bash
   git commit -am "chore: prepare version X.Y.X"
   git push
   ```
4. Once the PR is merged, tag the release on the `main` branch
   ```bash
   git fetch
   git tag X.Y.Z origin/main
   git push origin X.Y.Z
   ```
5. Wait for the [publishing workflow](https://github.com/adevinta/spark-android/actions/workflows/publish.yml) to build and publish the release.
6. Update the `version` in [gradle.properties](gradle.properties) to the next `SNAPSHOT` version.
7. Commit and push the changes to a new PR
  ```bash
  git commit -am "chore: prepare next development version"
  ```
8. Go to [Sonatype Nexus](https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/) to promote (close then release) the artifact ([docs & detailed steps](https://central.sonatype.org/publish/release/)). Or drop it if there is a problem!
9. Trigger the manual workflow [![ðŸ“‹ Publish Dokka to GitHub Pages](https://github.com/adevinta/spark-android/actions/workflows/dokka.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/adevinta/spark-android/actions/workflows/dokka.yml) with the version tag.
10. Draft a [new release](https://github.com/adevinta/spark-android/releases/new) with the version tag, add the corresponding [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) entries, and publish it when ready.

## Hotfix

Hotfixes can sometimes be a bit tricky to do right. Please follow these steps carefully:

1. Create the hotfix remote branch (the `hotfix` prefix is important)
   ```bash
   git push origin refs/tags/X.Y.Z:refs/heads/hotfix/X.Y.Z+1
   ```
2. Create a local hotfix PR branch
   ```bash
   git switch --create patch-hotfix-X.Y.Z+1 refs/tags/X.Y.Z
   ```
3. Commit the necessary changes and open a PR targeting the hotfix branch.
4. Once the PR is merged, you can continue with the regular release process described above.
5. Finally, merge these changes back to the main branch with a new PR
   ```bash
   git merge --no-ff refs/tags/X.Y.Z+1
   ```
