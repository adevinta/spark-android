[![üë∑ Build ‚Üí üßë‚Äçüî¨ Test ‚Üí üïµÔ∏è Lint](https://github.com/adevinta/spark-android/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/adevinta/spark-android/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Spark Design System is based on Material 3 Compose artifact described
on the [official documentation](https://material.io/) and maintained by Google developers
and designers.

But these native components and tokens are overridden to respect Spark's Visual Identity. You'll
find
the design specifications and technical information for supported platforms by Adevinta on
[zeroheight](https://zeroheight.com/1186e1705/p/25ae4e-spark).

The demo app is not currently available, but we plan to publish it in the near future.

## üöÄ Getting Started

A `SparkTheme` is available from where you can get all
colors, typographies and shapes in your composable hierarchy. Note that this theme is
mandatory if you want to use any Spark composable.
Otherwise, a runtime error will be thrown.

```kotlin
SparkTheme {
    // Your composable declarations
}
```

## Installation

Add the main Spark dependency: [![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.adevinta.spark/spark?label=%20&color=success)](https://central.sonatype.com/namespace/com.adevinta.spark) [![Sonatype Nexus (Snapshots)](https://img.shields.io/nexus/s/com.adevinta.spark/spark?label=%20&color=lightgrey&server=https%3A%2F%2Fs01.oss.sonatype.org%2F)](https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/com/adevinta/spark/spark/)

```kotlin
dependencies {
    // Import the Spark BoM
    implementation(platform("com.adevinta.spark:spark-bom:<version>"))

    implementation("com.adevinta.spark:spark")
    implementation("com.adevinta.spark:spark-icons")
}
```
