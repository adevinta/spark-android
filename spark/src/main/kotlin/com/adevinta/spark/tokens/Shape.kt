 * Components are grouped into shape categories based on their size. These categories provide a
 * way to change multiple component values at once, by changing the category’s values.
 * SparkShapes categories include:
 * - Small components
 * - Medium components
 * - Large components
 *
 * @param none A shape style with 4 same-sized corners whose size are equal to [RectangleShape].
 * By default app bars, navigation bars, banners, full-screen dialogs, and navigation rails use this shape.
 * @param extraSmall A shape style with 4 same-sized corners whose size are bigger than
 * [RectangleShape] and smaller than [SparkShapes.small]. By default autocomplete menu, select menu,
 * snackbars, standard menu, and text fields use this shape.
 * @param small A shape style with 4 same-sized corners whose size are bigger than
 * [SparkShapes.extraSmall] and smaller than [SparkShapes.medium]. By default chips use this shape.
 * @param medium A shape style with 4 same-sized corners whose size are bigger than [SparkShapes.small]
 * and smaller than [SparkShapes.large]. By default cards and small FABs use this shape.
 * @param large A shape style with 4 same-sized corners whose size are bigger than [SparkShapes.medium]
 * and smaller than [SparkShapes.extraLarge]. By default extended FABs, FABs, and navigation drawers use
 * this shape.
 * @param extraLarge A shape style with 4 same-sized corners whose size are bigger than
 * [SparkShapes.large] and smaller than [CircleShape]. By default large FABs, Bottom sheets, Dialogs and Time picker
 * use this shape.
 * @param full A shape style with 4 same-sized corners whose size are equal to [CircleShape]. By default large Badge,
 * Buttons, Icon buttons, Sliders, Switches and Search bar use this shape.
