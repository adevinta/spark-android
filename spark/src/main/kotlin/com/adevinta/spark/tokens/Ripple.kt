/**
 * Creates a Ripple using the provided values and values inferred from the theme.
 *
 * A Ripple is a Material implementation of [Indication] that expresses different [Interaction]s
 * by drawing ripple animations and state layers.
 *
 * A Ripple responds to [PressInteraction.Press] by starting a new ripple animation, and
 * responds to other [Interaction]s by showing a fixed state layer with varying alpha values
 * depending on the [Interaction].
 *
 * [SparkTheme] provides Ripples using [androidx.compose.foundation.LocalIndication], so a Ripple
 * will be used as the default [Indication] inside components such as
 * [androidx.compose.foundation.clickable] and [androidx.compose.foundation.indication], in
 * addition to Material provided components that use a Ripple as well.
 *
 * You can also explicitly create a Ripple and provide it to custom components in order to change
 * the parameters from the default, such as to create an unbounded ripple with a fixed size.
 *
 * To create a Ripple with a manually defined color that can change over time, see the other
 * [ripple] overload with a [ColorProducer] parameter. This will avoid unnecessary recompositions
 * when changing the color, and preserve existing ripple state when the color changes.
 *
 * @param bounded If true, ripples are clipped by the bounds of the target layout. Unbounded
 * ripples always animate from the target layout center, bounded ripples animate from the touch
 * position.
 * @param radius the radius for the ripple. If [Dp.Unspecified] is provided then the size will be
 * calculated based on the target layout size.
 * @param color the color of the ripple. This color is usually the same color used by the text or
 * iconography in the component. This color will then have [RippleDefaults.RippleAlpha]
 * applied to calculate the final color used to draw the ripple. If [Color.Unspecified] is
 * provided the color used will be [LocalContentColor] instead.
