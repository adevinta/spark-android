/**
 * Material Design fixed tabs.
 *
 * Fixed tabs display all tabs in a set simultaneously. They are best for switching between related
 * content quickly, such as between transportation methods in a map. To navigate between fixed tabs,
 * tap an individual tab, or swipe left or right in the content area.
 *
 * A TabRow contains a row of [Tab]s, and displays an indicator underneath the currently
 * selected tab. A TabRow places its tabs evenly spaced along the entire row, with each tab
 * taking up an equal amount of space. See [ScrollableTabRow] for a tab row that does not enforce
 * equal size, and allows scrolling to tabs that do not fit on screen.
 *
 * A simple example with text tabs looks like:
 *
 * @sample androidx.compose.material3.samples.TextTabs
 *
 * You can also provide your own custom tab, such as:
 *
 * @sample androidx.compose.material3.samples.FancyTabs
 *
 * Where the custom tab itself could look like:
 *
 * @sample androidx.compose.material3.samples.FancyTab
 *
 * As well as customizing the tab, you can also provide a custom [indicator], to customize
 * the indicator displayed for a tab. [indicator] will be placed to fill the entire TabRow, so it
 * should internally take care of sizing and positioning the indicator to match changes to
 * [selectedTabIndex].
 *
 * For example, given an indicator that draws a rounded rectangle near the edges of the [Tab]:
 *
 * @sample androidx.compose.material3.samples.FancyIndicator
 *
 * We can reuse [TabRowDefaults.tabIndicatorOffset] and just provide this indicator,
 * as we aren't changing how the size and position of the indicator changes between tabs:
 *
 * @sample androidx.compose.material3.samples.FancyIndicatorTabs
 *
 * You may also want to use a custom transition, to allow you to dynamically change the
 * appearance of the indicator as it animates between tabs, such as changing its color or size.
 * [indicator] is stacked on top of the entire TabRow, so you just need to provide a custom
 * transition that animates the offset of the indicator from the start of the TabRow. For
 * example, take the following example that uses a transition to animate the offset, width, and
 * color of the same FancyIndicator from before, also adding a physics based 'spring' effect to
 * the indicator in the direction of motion:
 *
 * @sample androidx.compose.material3.samples.FancyAnimatedIndicator
 *
 * We can now just pass this indicator directly to TabRow:
 *
 * @sample androidx.compose.material3.samples.FancyIndicatorContainerTabs
 *
 * @param selectedTabIndex the index of the currently selected tab
 * @param modifier the [Modifier] to be applied to this tab row
 * @param tabs the tabs inside this tab row. Typically this will be multiple [Tab]s. Each element
 * inside this lambda will be measured and placed evenly across the row, each taking up equal space.

/**
 * Material Design scrollable tabs.
 *
 * When a set of tabs cannot fit on screen, use scrollable tabs. Scrollable tabs can use longer text
 * labels and a larger number of tabs. They are best used for browsing on touch interfaces.
 *
 * A ScrollableTabRow contains a row of [Tab]s, and displays an indicator underneath the currently
 * selected tab. A ScrollableTabRow places its tabs offset from the starting edge, and allows
 * scrolling to tabs that are placed off screen. For a fixed tab row that does not allow
 * scrolling, and evenly places its tabs, see [TabRow].
 *
 * @param selectedTabIndex the index of the currently selected tab
 * @param modifier the [Modifier] to be applied to this tab row
 * @param containerColor the color used for the background of this tab row. Use [Color.Transparent]
 * to have no color.
 * @param contentColor the preferred color for content inside this tab row. Defaults to either the
 * matching content color for [containerColor], or to the current [LocalContentColor] if
 * [containerColor] is not a color from the theme.
 * @param edgePadding the padding between the starting and ending edge of the scrollable tab row,
 * and the tabs inside the row. This padding helps inform the user that this tab row can be
 * scrolled, unlike a [TabRow].
 * @param indicator the indicator that represents which tab is currently selected. By default this
 * will be a [TabRowDefaults.Indicator], using a [TabRowDefaults.tabIndicatorOffset] modifier to
 * animate its position. Note that this indicator will be forced to fill up the entire tab row, so
 * you should use [TabRowDefaults.tabIndicatorOffset] or similar to animate the actual drawn
 * indicator inside this space, and provide an offset from the start.
 * @param divider the divider displayed at the bottom of the tab row. This provides a layer of
 * separation between the tab row and the content displayed underneath.
 * @param tabs the tabs inside this tab row. Typically this will be multiple [Tab]s. Each element
 * inside this lambda will be measured and placed evenly across the row, each taking up equal space.
