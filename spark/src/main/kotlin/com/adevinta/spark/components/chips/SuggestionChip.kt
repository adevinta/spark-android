/**
 * <a href="https://m3.material.io/components/chips/overview" class="external" target="_blank">Material Design suggestion chip</a>.
 *
 * Chips help people enter information, make selections, filter content, or trigger actions. Chips
 * can show multiple interactive elements together in the same area, such as a list of selectable
 * movie times, or a series of email contacts.
 *
 * Suggestion chips help narrow a user's intent by presenting dynamically generated suggestions,
 * such as possible responses or search filters.
 *
 * ![Suggestion chip image](https://developer.android.com/images/reference/androidx/compose/material3/suggestion-chip.png)
 *
 * This suggestion chip is applied with a flat style. If you want an elevated style, use the
 * [ElevatedSuggestionChip].
 *
 * Example of a flat SuggestionChip with a trailing icon:
 * @sample androidx.compose.material3.samples.SuggestionChipSample
 *
 * @param onClick called when this chip is clicked
 * @param label text label for this chip
 * @param modifier the [Modifier] to be applied to this chip
 * @param enabled controls the enabled state of this chip. When `false`, this component will not
 * respond to user input, and it will appear visually disabled and disabled to accessibility
 * services.
 * @param icon optional icon at the start of the chip, preceding the [label] text
 * @param shape defines the shape of this chip's container, border (when [border] is not null), and
 * shadow (when using [elevation])
 * @param colors [ChipColors] that will be used to resolve the colors used for this chip in
 * different states. See [SuggestionChipDefaults.suggestionChipColors].
 * @param elevation [ChipElevation] used to resolve the elevation for this chip in different states.
 * This controls the size of the shadow below the chip. Additionally, when the container color is
 * [ColorScheme.surface], this controls the amount of primary color applied as an overlay. See
 * [SuggestionChipDefaults.suggestionChipElevation].
 * @param border the border to draw around the container of this chip. Pass `null` for no border.
 * See [SuggestionChipDefaults.suggestionChipBorder].
 * @param interactionSource the [MutableInteractionSource] representing the stream of [Interaction]s
 * for this chip. You can create and pass in your own `remember`ed instance to observe
 * [Interaction]s and customize the appearance / behavior of this chip in different states.
