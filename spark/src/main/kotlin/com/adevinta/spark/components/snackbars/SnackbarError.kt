/**
 *
 * Snackbars provide brief messages about app processes at the bottom of the screen.
 *
 * Snackbars inform users of a process that an app has performed or will perform. They appear
 * temporarily, towards the bottom of the screen. They shouldn’t interrupt the user experience,
 * and they don’t require user input to disappear.
 *
 * A Snackbar can contain a single action. Because Snackbar disappears automatically, the action
 * shouldn't be "Dismiss" or "Cancel".
 *
 * If you want to customize appearance of the [Snackbar], you can pass your own version as a child
 * of the [SnackbarHost] to the [Scaffold]
 *
 * If you want to change dynamically the snackbar color look at [Snackbar].
 *
 * @param modifier modifiers for the Snackbar layout
 * @param actionOnNewLine whether or not action should be put on the separate line. Recommended
 * for action with long action text
 * @param icon icon to be shown on the start side of the content when there's no title.
 * @param title title to be shown above the [content], currently the SnackBarHost doesn't handle it so avoid using it
 * @param actionLabel action to add as an action to the snackbar.
 * @param onActionClick callback when the action is clicked.
 * @param content content to show information about a process that an app has performed or will
 * perform
