/**
 * Material surface is the central metaphor in material design. Each surface exists at a given
 * elevation, which influences how that piece of surface visually relates to other surfaces and how
 * that surface is modified by tonal variance.
 *
 * See the other overloads for clickable, selectable, and toggleable surfaces.
 *
 * The Surface is responsible for:
 *
 * 1) Clipping: Surface clips its children to the shape specified by [shape]
 *
 * 2) Borders: If [shape] has a border, then it will also be drawn.
 *
 * 3) Background: Surface fills the shape specified by [shape] with the [color]. If [color] is
 * [ColorScheme.surface] a color overlay will be applied. The color of the overlay depends on the
 * [tonalElevation] of this Surface, and the [LocalAbsoluteTonalElevation] set by any parent
 * surfaces. This ensures that a Surface never appears to have a lower elevation overlay than its
 * ancestors, by summing the elevation of all previous Surfaces.
 *
 * 4) Content color: Surface uses [contentColor] to specify a preferred color for the content of
 * this surface - this is used by the [Text] and [Icon] components as a default color.
 *
 * If no [contentColor] is set, this surface will try and match its background color to a color
 * defined in the theme [ColorScheme], and return the corresponding content color. For example, if
 * the [color] of this surface is [ColorScheme.surface], [contentColor] will be set to
 * [ColorScheme.onSurface]. If [color] is not part of the theme palette, [contentColor] will keep
 * the same value set above this Surface.
 *
 * To manually retrieve the content color inside a surface, use [LocalContentColor].
 *
 * 5) Blocking touch propagation behind the surface.
 *
 * Surface sample:
 * @sample androidx.compose.material3.samples.SurfaceSample
 *
 * @param modifier Modifier to be applied to the layout corresponding to the surface
 * @param shape Defines the surface's shape as well its shadow.
 * @param color The background color. Use [Color.Transparent] to have no color.
 * @param contentColor The preferred content color provided by this Surface to its children.
 * Defaults to either the matching content color for [color], or if [color] is not a color from the
 * theme, this will keep the same value set above this Surface.
 * @param tonalElevation When [color] is [ColorScheme.surface], a higher the elevation will result
 * in a darker color in light theme and lighter color in dark theme.
 * @param shadowElevation The size of the shadow below the surface. To prevent shadow creep, only
 * apply shadow elevation when absolutely necessary, such as when the surface requires visual
 * separation from a patterned background. Note that It will not affect z index of the Surface.
 * If you want to change the drawing order you can use `Modifier.zIndex`.
 * @param border Optional border to draw on top of the surface

/**
 * Material surface is the central metaphor in material design. Each surface exists at a given

 *
 * This version of Surface is responsible for a click handling as well as everything else that a
 * regular Surface does:
 *
 * This clickable Surface is responsible for:
 *
 * 1) Clipping: Surface clips its children to the shape specified by [shape]
 *
 * 2) Borders: If [shape] has a border, then it will also be drawn.
 *
 * 3) Background: Surface fills the shape specified by [shape] with the [color]. If [color] is

 * If [color] is not part of the theme palette, [contentColor] will keep the same value set above
 * this Surface.
 *
 * 5) Click handling. This version of surface will react to the clicks, calling [onClick] lambda,
 * updating the [interactionSource] when [PressInteraction] occurs, and showing ripple indication in
 * response to press events. If you don't need click handling, consider using the Surface function
 * that doesn't require [onClick] param. If you need to set a custom label for the [onClick], apply
 * a `Modifier.semantics { onClick(label = "YOUR_LABEL", action = null) }` to the Surface.
 *
 * 6) Semantics for clicks. Just like with [Modifier.clickable], clickable version of Surface will
 * produce semantics to indicate that it is clicked. Also, by default, accessibility services will
 * describe the element as [Role.Button]. You may change this by passing a desired [Role] with a
 * [Modifier.semantics].
 *
 * To manually retrieve the content color inside a surface, use [LocalContentColor].
 *
 * Clickable surface sample:
 * @sample androidx.compose.material3.samples.ClickableSurfaceSample
 *
 * @param onClick callback to be called when the surface is clicked
 * @param modifier Modifier to be applied to the layout corresponding to the surface
 * @param enabled Controls the enabled state of the surface. When `false`, this surface will not be
 * clickable
 * @param shape Defines the surface's shape as well its shadow. A shadow is only displayed if the
 * [tonalElevation] is greater than zero.
 * @param color The background color. Use [Color.Transparent] to have no color.
 * @param contentColor The preferred content color provided by this Surface to its children.
 * Defaults to either the matching content color for [color], or if [color] is not a color from the
 * theme, this will keep the same value set above this Surface.
 * @param border Optional border to draw on top of the surface

 * @param shadowElevation The size of the shadow below the surface. Note that It will not affect z
 * index of the Surface. If you want to change the drawing order you can use `Modifier.zIndex`.
 * @param interactionSource the [MutableInteractionSource] representing the stream of [Interaction]s
 * for this Surface. You can create and pass in your own remembered [MutableInteractionSource] if
 * you want to observe [Interaction]s and customize the appearance / behavior of this Surface in
 * different [Interaction]s.
