/**
 * Mutual exclusion for UI state mutation over time.
 *
 * [mutate] permits interruptible state mutation over time using a standard [MutatePriority].
 * A [InternalMutatorMutex] enforces that only a single writer can be active at a time for a particular
 * state resource. Instead of queueing callers that would acquire the lock like a traditional
 * [Mutex], new attempts to [mutate] the guarded state will either cancel the current mutator or
 * if the current mutator has a higher priority, the new caller will throw [CancellationException].
 *
 * [InternalMutatorMutex] should be used for implementing hoisted state objects that many mutators may
 * want to manipulate over time such that those mutators can coordinate with one another. The
 * [InternalMutatorMutex] instance should be hidden as an implementation detail. For example:
