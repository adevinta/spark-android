/**
 * <a href="https://m3.material.io/components/chips/overview" class="external" target="_blank">Material Design input chip</a>.
 *
 * Chips help people enter information, make selections, filter content, or trigger actions. Chips
 * can show multiple interactive elements together in the same area, such as a list of selectable
 * movie times, or a series of email contacts.
 *
 * Input chips represent discrete pieces of information entered by a user.
 *
 * ![Input chip image](https://developer.android.com/images/reference/androidx/compose/material3/input-chip.png)
 *
 * An Input Chip can have a leading icon or an avatar at its start. In case both are provided, the
 * avatar will take precedence and will be displayed.
 *
 * Alternatively, use Accompanist's [Flow Layouts](https://google.github.io/accompanist/flowlayout/)
 * to wrap chips to a new line.
 *
 * @param selected whether this chip is selected or not
 * @param onClick called when this chip is clicked
 * @param label text label for this chip
 * @param modifier the [Modifier] to be applied to this chip
 * @param enabled controls the enabled state of this chip. When `false`, this component will not
 * respond to user input, and it will appear visually disabled and disabled to accessibility
 * services.
 * @param leadingIcon optional icon at the start of the chip, preceding the [label] text
 * @param avatar optional avatar at the start of the chip, preceding the [label] text
 * @param trailingIcon optional icon at the end of the chip
 * @param shape defines the shape of this chip's container, border (when [border] is not null), and
 * shadow (when using [elevation])
 * @param colors [ChipColors] that will be used to resolve the colors used for this chip in
 * different states. See [InputChipDefaults.inputChipColors].
 * @param elevation [ChipElevation] used to resolve the elevation for this chip in different states.
 * This controls the size of the shadow below the chip. Additionally, when the container color is
 * [ColorScheme.surface], this controls the amount of main color applied as an overlay. See
 * [InputChipDefaults.inputChipElevation].
 * @param border the border to draw around the container of this chip. Pass `null` for no border.
 * See [InputChipDefaults.inputChipBorder].
 * @param interactionSource the [MutableInteractionSource] representing the stream of [Interaction]s
 * for this chip. You can create and pass in your own `remember`ed instance to observe
 * [Interaction]s and customize the appearance / behavior of this chip in different states.
